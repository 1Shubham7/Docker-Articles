## Docker Swarm: Building a Highly Scalable Cluster

Docker Swarm is one of the most popular container orchestration engines. It is not only used by professional engineers but also by people is their learning phase of how operations work.
What makes Docker Swarm so popular is the fact that is very lightweight and very simple to understand – you don’t even have to learn a new CLI for Docker Swarm, we can use it with Docker CLI.
In this article, we will learn about Docker Swarm, its features, and use cases and will also go through a tutorial to create highly scalable clusters in Docker Swarm...

## Understanding the Docker Desktop Architecture and Linux Building Block for Containers

In this article we are going to do a technology deep dive and start understanding the foundational Linux kernel features that software like Docker is using to make the containers work and
provide those isolated environments that we all use. then towards the end of this section, we’ll also take a look at the docker system architecture...
